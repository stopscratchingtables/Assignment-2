As a basketball fan, I always find myself immersing into the statisitics and analytics of sports data. Creating charts to see a player or team's shooting percentage, calculating a team's statistics to get desired and getting into the nerdy aspects of basketball analytics is something I love to do during my free time! 
Furthermore, I know I'm not the only one... There are many basketball nerds out there who love to get into the fine and smaller details of the game by creating their own fantasy balanced lineups that would dominate the league!
 
## Design Process :gem:

During the design process, I thought of what layouts, colours and media that would grab the attention of basketball fans. As a basketball fan, I realised that I have much interest with the website displaying pictures of NBA Players and having cool and querky icons. Hence, I combed through the internet for the best quality pictures and royalty-free icons that I can use on my website. I also realised that there is a trend of having websites looking minimilastic and having a "Dark Mode" function. Hence, I have added the following details by using minimal colours and having a dark mode function.

Afterwards, I though about the functionalities of the website and what a basketball fan would want from a website that is trying to attract their attention. Hence, I have added the following features (refer to the features section). 

Once I was very sure of the functionalities, layouts, colours and media of the website, I began sketching it by creating a wireframe for my website on Adobe Xd. I kept in mind of the designs for both on PC and mobile. This was to make sure most devices would be compatible with this website. Hence, I used bootstrap as it already has pre-done media-queries that will make my website mobile friendly. However, I thought about more intruging ideas and changes I should make to my website to ensure it can reach it's potential in entisng my target audience.

### Changes to WireFrame

#### BuildStarting5.html
- A 'Build Your Starting 5!' page
I realised that sports fans in general love to fantasise different lineups and formations.
Hence, I feel like this aspect of the website can 

#### IndivStats.html
- No Display of Player's Picure
There were no free APIs that included a player's photo that were updated and high quality.
Hence, I decided to remove entirely

- Change Placeholder player example "Lebron James" instead of "Stephen Curry"
The player is injured and out for the season. Hence, no statistics were showing up when his name was
searched. I chose "Lebron James" instead as he is playing this season.

#### Teamstats.html
- Add Team's Logo
